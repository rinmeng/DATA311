# Introduction

Hello! My name is ***Rin***. I am in ***3rd year*** pursuing BSc ***Major Computer Science***, ***Minor in Data Science.***

# Data Wrangling

```{r}
# 5 import df
df <- read.csv("sales_data.csv")

# 6 print head and srt of df
head(df)
str(df)

# 7 print non duplicates
unique(df)

# 8 check for missing values
na_count <- data.frame(colSums(is.na(df)))
names(na_count) <- "na_count"
na_count

# 9 filter sales to new york
newYorkSales = df[df$Store.Location == 'New York',]
newYorkSales

# 10 highest sale in new york
newYorkSales[which.max(newYorkSales$Price),"Date"]

# 11 determine the most frequently payment method used by customer
payments <- table(newYorkSales$Payment.Method)
names(payments)[which.max(payments)]
```

# Data Visualization

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=10, fig.align='center'}
# 12 Create a histogram of Customer Age and label the x-axis as “Customer Age”. Adjust the plot dimensions so that it is taller than it is wide.
hist(df$Customer.Age, main = "Histogram of Customer Age", xlab="Customer Age" , ylim = c(0, 10))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-q-vs-p
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between Quantity and Price"
#| fig-align: 'center'  
# 13 Scatter plot of x = quantity sold vs y = price
plot(Price ~ Quantity.Sold , data = df, xlab = 'Quantity Sold', ylab='Price', main = 'Relationship between Quantity and Price')

```

14. Based on the scatter plot @fig-q-vs-p, it seems that people tend to buy less if the price is expensive, and more if the price is cheap.
